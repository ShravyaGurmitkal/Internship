      "Full Review: I rate this product 5* as it has got amazing user experience with the best performing A13 bionic processor. The screen responds and graphics rendering is top notch. With casual gaming and internet browsing, the battery lasts for approx. 1 day. Camera is very good. You will fall in love with the portrait mode. You can call me a loyal Apple customer or whatever but I won’t stop praising the products and overall experience. That user experience matters and is worth every penny you pay.\n",
